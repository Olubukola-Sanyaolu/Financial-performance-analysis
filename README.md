#  Finance Dashboard Analytics (Power BI)

##  Project Overview  
This project leverages **Power BI** to analyze financial performance across **income, expenses, savings, and transactions**. The goal is to uncover patterns, inefficiencies, and growth opportunities while providing **data-driven recommendations** for decision-making.

---

##  Business Problem  
The company is facing **financial instability** despite strong revenue growth. While income has increased and expenses reduced, **savings have dropped by 27%** and **transaction failures remain high**. This raises concerns about **cash flow management, operational inefficiencies, and client retention**.

---

##  Objectives  
1. **Strengthen financial stability** by improving savings and reinvestment strategies.  
2. **Enhance transaction efficiency** by reducing failed and pending transactions.  
3. **Optimize client management** by identifying risky vs reliable clients.  
4. **Enable proactive decision-making** with automated KPIs and alerts in Power BI.

##  Key Insights  

###  Income  
- Total: **$280,913**  
- Growth: **+24.6% vs last month**  
 Positive performance â€” strong revenue momentum.

### Savings  
- Current: **$245,810**  
- Change: **-27.0% vs last month (~-$90.9K)**  
   Despite higher income and lower expenses, savings **fell significantly**, indicating poor reinvestment/cash flow strategy.  

### Transactions

 Engagement is rising.  
 High rate of **failed transactions** â€” sample shows 3 of 5 clients (â‰ˆ60%) had failed or pending payments.  

### Client-Level Breakdown  
- **Davis**: $1,156 (recent, pending).

   Multiple **failed or pending transactions** â†’ revenue leakage risk.

### 4.  Seasonal Planning  
- Replicate Juneâ€™s campaign across off-peak months.  
- Boost off-season revenue by **~20% (~$56K/month)** or **$168K per quarter**.  

### 5.  Power BI KPI Tracking  
- Build drill-through reports for:  
  - Failed vs Successful transaction ratios.  
  - Savings growth over time.  
  - Client contribution by tier.  
- Set alerts for:  
  - Savings drop >20%

##  Quantified Conclusion  

- Income grew by **$55.4K (+24.6%)** and expenses fell by **$74.8K (-24.5%)**, but savings dropped by **$90.9K (-27%)**.
